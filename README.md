# Key Features:
  1. Scrape and Display News Articles:
      - Users input an article URL, and the app retrieves the article's title and content using the requests library and BeautifulSoup for HTML parsing.
      - The article title is prominently displayed, and the content is shown dynamically in a text area.
      - Markdown Formatting and Saving:
      - Articles can be saved in Markdown or text format.
      - The saved content includes a formatted title (as a Markdown header) and body text, with URLs converted into clickable Markdown links.

  2. Interactive GUI:
     - Built with tkinter, the app has an intuitive layout:
        - A field to input the article URL.
        - A "Scrape Article" button to fetch and display the article's content.
        - A "Save Article" button to store the content in a chosen file format.
        - The GUI's light pink background creates a visually appealing design.
          
  3. Error Handling:
     - The app provides clear error messages if the URL is invalid, the article cannot be fetched, or there's a connectivity issue.
       
  4. Customization:
     - Fonts and layout components are styled for user-friendliness and readability.
     - A compact, user-centered design ensures seamless interaction.

# How to Use:
  1. Enter a valid article URL in the text field.
  2. Click the "Scrape Article" button to fetch and display the article's title and content.
